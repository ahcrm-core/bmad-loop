"""`events.py` — the importable twin of the stdlib-only hook relay, and the
`bmad-loop relay` command built on it.

Two things are under test. The twin's *source parity* with
`data/bmad_loop_hook.py`, because two separately-maintained writers of one
control plane is how the hardening in one silently stops applying to the other.
And the twin's *behavior*, mirrored from the #493 hardening tests in
test_hook_script.py — a copy that is byte-identical today can still be edited on
both sides at once, and these are what say the shape still holds.
