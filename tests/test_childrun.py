"""The stop-aware child runner (DW-353): the probe, the tree kill, and the
exception-safe teardown behind verify commands and declarative hooks.

The real-process rows drive a genuine process TREE — a shell (or cmd.exe) root
with a grandchild — because the defect this seam fixes is exactly what a
single-process fake cannot show: killing the root alone orphans the grandchild.
The fake-host rows pin the ordering doctrine (harvest before the first signal,
win32 force-kills the root before anything polite) that no single platform can
exercise both arms of.

# ---- the drain-timeout arm ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# The only production path into `timeout_stream` since DW-353: a timed-out or
# interrupted command's output normally comes from the completed post-kill
# `communicate`, already text-mode decoded. Only when a pipe-holder the tree kill
# cannot reach outlives `DRAIN_S` does the drain raise `TimeoutExpired`, handing
# over the raw POSIX chunks for `timeout_stream` to decode. The holder here is the
# documented `kill_tree` limit made concrete: a background job double-forked out of
# a subshell that exits at once, so it is reparented away from the root before any
# harvest (the loop's first one is `HARVEST_S` in) and keeps the pipes open.
#
# Driven inside an ASCII-locale child interpreter for the reason the #378 rows in
# tests/test_verify.py give: every CI leg is UTF-8, where the locale codec and a
# hardcoded UTF-8 decode agree, so the codec half of the normalisation can only be
# observed under `LC_ALL=C` + `PYTHONUTF8=0`.
