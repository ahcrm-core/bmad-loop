"""Unit tests for the WorktreeFlow collaborator (issue #244 F-3/F-9a).

WorktreeFlow was carved out of Engine's worktree isolation/integration cluster.
These exercise it in isolation — built from narrow deps + stub engine callbacks,
no Engine instance — which is the point of the extraction. End-to-end behavior
under a real Engine stays covered by test_engine_worktree.py.
