"""Model of sprint-status.yaml — the single source of workflow truth.

The dev primitive `bmad-build-auto` deliberately does not touch sprint-status
("the orchestrator's business"), so the orchestrator is the single writer via
:func:`advance` — idempotent, never-regress, epic-lift. The orchestrator
otherwise only re-reads this file to pick the next story and verify what a
session claims.

Never-regress has exactly one kind of exception, and it is opt-in per call:
``advance(..., allow_regression=True)`` may move a row backward only through a
pair allowlisted in :data:`~bmad_loop.statemachine.BOARD_REGRESSIONS` (today
``done -> awaiting-operator``, a review pass demoting a finished story to a park,
DW-383). Any other regressing pair raises
:class:`~bmad_loop.statemachine.IllegalTransition` and writes nothing, so legal
board moves still live only in ``statemachine.py``.

Concurrency (#286/#469): being the sole writer is not on its own mutual
exclusion — a second orchestrator process (another `bmad-loop run`, a sweep, the
TUI) runs the same sole writer, and :func:`advance` is a read-modify-write of the
whole board, so two of them would both read, both edit, and let the last atomic
write win. :func:`advance` therefore serializes itself cross-process on the
board's state-root sidecar lock, and holds it across every read that decides the
PUBLISHED BYTES as well as the write itself. That invariant is deliberately
narrower than "every read": one advisory pre-lock probe may answer a
read-dependent no-op — an absent row, or a row already at or past target —
without acquiring at all (#736), because such a call publishes nothing and so has
no bytes for the hold to protect. Readers stay lock-free: the publish is an
atomic replace, so a reader sees either the old board entire or the new one.

Refusal is loud (#842): the writer is a line edit, not a YAML round-trip, so some
shapes the parser reads it will not rewrite. An existing row :func:`advance` has
decided to move and cannot rewrite raises :class:`SprintStatusWriteRefused`
(board, row, current, target, a stable reason) and publishes nothing, rather than
echoing the unchanged status a caller would read as "the session never got there".
An absent row, a missing board, and a row already at or past target still answer
by return value.

Retro action items (DW-388): ``bmad-retrospective`` appends the items a retro
commits to a top-level ``action_items:`` list, each with a stable ``id`` and a
``ref`` back to the retro document. :func:`load_action_items` reads that list on
its own, independently of :func:`load`, so ``development_status`` parsing — and
the ``RETRO_ITEM_RE``-keyed rows it recognizes — is untouched by it. The sweep is
its one consumer: it files each unseen, not-``done`` item into the deferred-work
ledger. Nothing here writes the list.

def _set_mapping_value(lines: list[str], key: str, new_value: str, *, scope: _Scope) -> _Edit:
    """In-place replace the value of the ``key`` entry in ``scope``, preserving
    indentation and any trailing ` # comment`. A minimal line edit (not a YAML
    round-trip) so the file's comments and structure — STATUS DEFINITIONS,
    WORKFLOW NOTES — survive verbatim.

    Which line is edited is decided by the parser, not by a text search:
    :func:`_locate_row` names the key line and the value's exact source span in
    ``scope`` (story and epic rows under ``development_status``, ``last_updated``
    at the root). A textual scan would take the first line that merely looks like
    the row — inside an earlier block scalar, under another mapping, or a
    duplicate the parser overrides — and rewrite it while the real row stays put.

    The split between value and comment is two-stage: the key prefix is matched
    first and the whole remainder captured, then that remainder decides for
    itself. An unquoted value keeps the wide class this board needs — it
    legitimately contains spaces (`last_updated: 01-06-2026 10:00`), which is why
    it cannot borrow `frontmatter._VALUE_COMMENT_RE`'s conservative token gate —
    and cedes an inline comment only at whitespace, as YAML does. A remainder
    that OPENS WITH A QUOTE is taken whole and no comment is recognized in it at
    all: a fused pattern would guess the boundary from the last ` #` on the line
    and turn `status: "a # b"` into `status: done # b"`, promoting scalar text
    into a comment the board never had (#366). The span proves the closing quote
    is on the key line, but not where on it, so a comment sitting after one is
    dropped rather than guessed at. Lossy, never wrong, and only a hand-edit
    reaches it: the writer replaces such a value with a bare token on the next
    advance.

    Returns ``"changed"`` after a real edit, ``"equal"`` when the value is already
    ``new_value`` (idempotent, nothing edited), ``"absent"`` when ``scope`` holds no
    ``key`` entry, and :class:`_Refused` when the entry is there but the line edit
    cannot rewrite it exactly — a key authored in quotes or flow style, a value
    that is a collection or an alias, a remainder neither arm can read, a
    multi-line shape below. ``lines`` is untouched on every answer but
    ``"changed"``. Refused is deliberately not folded into absent: whether a
    declined row is an error is the caller's decision (:func:`_advance_locked`
    raises for the story row), and it can only make it on an answer that says
    which happened. Each line's terminator is excluded from the scalar match and
    then reattached exactly as authored (#576).

    A value may also run past the key line. The one such shape this reads is the
    FOLDED plain row a width-limited dump (ruamel wraps at 80) emits for a long
    key: nothing but whitespace after the colon, then a plain scalar starting on
    the very next line. :func:`_folded_span_is_plain` checks its lines; the key
    line and exactly the value's span collapse into one `key: value` line that
    takes the terminator the span's last line had. A value that STARTS on the key
    line is edited only when its span ends there too. Every other multi-line
    value — a block scalar (`|`, `>`), a quoted or plain scalar that wraps from
    the key line (whatever the indentation of its later lines), a nested mapping
    or sequence, a comment or blank line inside or before the value — is refused
    whole: rewriting only the key line would leave the rest behind as part of
    the value (`key: done` over `    backlog` parses as `done backlog`) or turn
    it into invalid YAML."""

    parent epic to `in-progress` only when advancing a story to `in-progress`;
    refresh `last_updated` when `now` is given. Comments/structure are preserved
    via line edits. Returns the story's status after the call (== `target` on a
    write), or None when nothing was eligible.

    Raises :class:`SprintStatusWriteRefused` when the row exists, the call has
    decided to move it (below `target`, or an allowlisted regression), and the
    line edit cannot rewrite its shape — a quoted key, an alias, a block scalar.
    Nothing is written then, not even the epic lift or `last_updated`. This used
    to return the unchanged status, which a caller cannot tell from a story that
    never got there; the raise names the board, the row, and why (#842).

    The rewrite is atomic and symlink-following (#379), and every existing CRLF,
    LF, bare CR, or mixed per-line terminator is preserved (#576). The board is
    read as raw UTF-8 bytes, each edited line carries its own terminator, and
    `atomic_write_bytes` publishes the byte-exact result. This is a
    read-modify-rewrite of the board, and a truncating write that faults partway
    through corrupts it SILENTLY: YAML cut at a line boundary is still a valid
    mapping, just a smaller one, so the epics past the tear cease to exist rather
    than raising. AGENTS.md makes this the orchestrator's sole write path to
    sprint-status.yaml, so nothing downstream would contradict the shortened
    board — the run would simply walk off the end of the sprint. The atomic
    helper keeps the file entire: either the old contents or the whole new ones,
    never a prefix.

    Symlinks are FOLLOWED (the helper's default), which is what the old
    truncating write did too — the board is an operator-curated file at a
    project-relative path, and a repo that symlinks it somewhere must keep being
    a symlink. That rules out the confined writers, which are no-follow by
    construction: this site takes the #597 flag and nothing else.

    ``require_writable_target=True`` is that flag, and it restores what going
    atomic silently dropped: `os.replace` needs write permission on the parent
    DIRECTORY, never on the entry it replaces, so a board an operator had marked
    read-only was rewritten anyway — and because the mode is inherited it came
    back reading ``0444``, leaving nothing in the permission bits to record that
    it changed (#597). The truncating `write_bytes` this replaced raised
    `PermissionError` there as a side effect of opening the file; that refusal is
    a property worth keeping deliberately, because AGENTS.md makes this the
    orchestrator's SOLE write path to the board — a read-only board is the only
    way an operator can say "stop rewriting this", and it has to mean something.

    Serialized cross-process (#286/#469) on the board's advisory lock — the
    state-root sidecar :func:`~bmad_loop.runs.lock_path_for` names for it, not a
    sibling of the board itself, because the board is a tracked file and the
    engine's own ``git add -A`` would commit a sidecar beside it. The hold spans
    the whole read-modify-write and nothing else: three reads (the status probe,
    the raw bytes, the epic-lift ``load``) and the one atomic write, with no
    subprocess, session, or operator pause inside it (#286). That also closes the
    intra-call TOCTOU, since the never-regress decision and the bytes it is
    applied to now come from one hold rather than from two independent reads.

    Two answers are reached BEFORE the lock. The missing-board check runs first,
    so asking about a board that does not exist leaves no sidecar behind. Then an
    ADVISORY probe (#736) reads the row once and answers the two cases in which
    this call would write nothing at all: an absent row (``None``) and a row
    already at or past ``target`` (the current status, via :func:`_row_at_or_past`
    — the same predicate the locked body applies). Acquiring for those was the
    defect: an idempotent replay — ``bmad-loop confirm`` against a story the board
    already records as done is a designed path, not an error
    (:meth:`~bmad_loop.model.ParkedStory.resumable` accepts it), as is
    ``_carry_board_advance``'s routine no-op on a tracked board — could fail on
    lock contention, or on a :class:`~bmad_loop.runs.StateRootError` from
    :func:`~bmad_loop.runs.lock_path_for`, for work it was never going to do.

    The probe is advisory in the strict sense: only a "would write nothing"
    answer is acted on, and such a call simply linearizes at the probe's read
    rather than at an acquisition. Every other outcome — including ANY exception
    raised while probing — falls through to the locked path, which re-reads,
    re-decides authoritatively and raises on the channel it always did. So the
    probe can neither authorize a write nor add a failure mode the hold lacks: a
    malformed board still raises :class:`SprintStatusError` from under the lock,
    and a write refusal is decided there too, never by the probe.
    ``now`` needs no handling here, because both no-op arms of
    :func:`_advance_locked` return before the ``last_updated`` write; a
    probe-satisfied early-out is write-equivalent to the locked answer.

    Acquisition failure — for the calls that do reach the lock — surfaces as
    ``OSError`` (or :class:`~bmad_loop.runs.StateRootError` when no state root can
    be derived) on the channel callers already route this function's raises
    through — the engine's crash/escalation handling, the CLI's failure exit — so
    a board that could not be serialized fails loudly rather than being rewritten
    unlocked. :func:`advanced_bytes` deliberately does NOT come through
    here: it calls :func:`_advance_locked` against a private throwaway copy, so it
    neither contends on the real board's sidecar nor mints one of its own.

    ``allow_regression=True`` is the one allowlisted exception to never-regress
    (DW-383). A row strictly PAST ``target`` is then moved back to it when the
    ``(current, target)`` pair is in
    :data:`~bmad_loop.statemachine.BOARD_REGRESSIONS`; any other regressing pair
    raises :class:`~bmad_loop.statemachine.IllegalTransition` and writes nothing.
    Forward moves, a row already AT ``target``, and absent rows behave exactly as
    without the flag. The advisory probe never answers a regression the flag asks
    for — it falls through to the lock, and the allowlist check runs there, under
    the hold, because the probe swallows every exception it meets.
    :func:`advanced_bytes` never passes the flag.
