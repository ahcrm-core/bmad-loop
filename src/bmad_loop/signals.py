"""Watch the per-run events directory for hook-written event files.

The hook script (data/bmad_loop_hook.py) and its importable twin (:mod:`events`,
behind ``bmad-loop relay``) write one JSON file per event, atomically (tmp +
rename), named "<ts_ns>-<task_id>-<event>.json". Plain polling of a near-empty
directory is cheap and crash-safe; no inotify.

Two directories, not one (#494). The channel now lives out of the project tree,
under the user-scoped state root (``runs.events_dir_for``), because a branch
switch, a worktree mount or a rollback must not be able to take a live run's
control plane away. The *legacy* in-tree ``<run_dir>/events`` stays polled as
well, and that is the whole version-skew guard: the relay a target project has
installed is a COPY taken at init time, so an upgraded orchestrator routinely
drives sessions whose hook only knows the old location. Without the second poll
that pairing loses every Stop event and every session stalls to
``session_timeout_min`` — the loudest possible regression, delivered silently.

@dataclass
class SessionAttribution:
    """Second layer after :func:`is_session_event`: which CLI session inside one
    attempt's event stream is the launched one (#767).

    A nested coding-CLI process started from inside the session inherits the
    relay environment, so its SessionStart/Stop/SessionEnd land in the parent's
    stream under the parent's task id. The rule is a deny-list: an id is foreign
    only once it has announced its own SessionStart after the launched session's
    first SessionStart. Every other event is admitted — id-less events, ids that
    never announced a start (a rotated id, a Copilot ``toolu_`` subagent Stop),
    and anything before the first start, including an identified SessionEnd from
    a CLI that exited before its SessionStart fired (#727). Failing toward
    acceptance keeps attribution a pure filter: it only ever drops a known
    child's events and never adds a completion path.

    The first SessionStart is the launched session's whether identified or not:
    an anonymous start (a payload the relay could not read) still uses up the
    parent's slot, so a child's identified start after it is foreign.

    A later SessionStart with a new id whose ``source`` is in
    :data:`REBIND_SOURCES` ("clear", "compact") is the launched session itself
    rotating its id, so it rebinds rather than going foreign. Deliberately not
    "resume" — a nested child launched with ``--resume`` must stay foreign, and a
    bmad-loop resume is a new attempt with a fresh task id and so a fresh
    attribution — and not "startup", which is exactly what a nested child sends.
    An older vendored relay forwards no ``source``, so there a clear/compact start
    with a new id reads as foreign and the session falls back to window death or
    its timeout; ``bmad-loop init`` re-vendors the relay.

    ``source`` alone is not trusted. An id already found foreign never rebinds
    (a child compacting under its own id), and a "clear" start after a foreign
    id's SessionEnd is that child clearing — claude ends the old session with a
    SessionEnd before the clear start — so the new id is foreign too, unless the
    bound session also ended since the last start (the two relays write
    independently, so a child's end can land between the parent's end and its
    clear start). A child that rotates its id without a preceding SessionEnd
    still rebinds on ``source`` alone — unless lineage is trusted (below).

    Lineage (DW-507). Each relay tags its event ``lineage`` "match" (the launched
    CLI fired the hook), "mismatch" (something else did — a nested CLI) or
    "unknown" (unreadable: no ``/proc`` on Windows or macOS, an older
    orchestrator). The launched session's own first SessionStart calibrates it:
    unpinned, the first start is taken to be that one; pinned, it is the first
    identified start the pin admits, so a child's start that wins the race to the
    events dir — identified or anonymous — calibrates nothing. Tagged "match", lineage
    is ``"trusted"`` and every later "mismatch" event is foreign — id-less ones
    too, and a "clear"/"compact" rotation that would otherwise rebind — its id
    joining ``foreign_ids`` and its SessionEnd setting ``foreign_ended``. Tagged
    "mismatch", the CLI's hook architecture defeats the relay's heuristic
    (``"miscalibrated"``); "unknown" or untagged (an older vendored relay),
    lineage is ``"unavailable"``. Either way lineage is ignored for the attempt
    and the rules above stand alone. Failing toward acceptance still holds: an
    event carrying one of the launched session's own ids is never made foreign
    by lineage, and events before calibration ignore it (#727).

    Pinning (DW-505/508). When the adapter chose the launched session's id
    itself — the profile's ``session_id_flag``, e.g. claude's ``--session-id`` —
    it passes that id as ``pinned_id`` and the parent is known before any event
    arrives. The first SessionStart then binds nothing (the pin already did);
    every id ever bound — the pin plus each clear/compact rebind — is the
    launched session's own, and an identified SessionStart or SessionEnd from any
    other id is foreign. So a child that fires SessionEnd without ever announcing
    a SessionStart is dropped instead of crashing the parent (DW-508), and an
    unannounced SessionEnd before the parent's own start is foreign too, while
    the parent's own pre-start SessionEnd (#727) is still admitted. Other events
    (``Stop`` and the rest) from a never-announced id are still admitted — a
    Copilot ``toolu_`` subagent Stop relies on that.

    Accepted limitation, unpinned only: without a pin, a child SessionEnd whose
    child never announced a SessionStart is indistinguishable from the parent's
    own and is admitted. Nested CLIs announce their start, so this is documented,
    not defended. :func:`attribute_events` always replays unpinned, so the sweep
    diagnostic keeps this limitation even for a pinned profile."""
