"""Attempt rollback + recovery-ref preservation flow.

Extracted from :class:`bmad_loop.engine.Engine` (issue #244, PR 2/2): the
rollback/preserve cluster is an independent recovery state machine. It lives
here as a collaborator built from narrow dependencies (repo paths, the policy,
run state, journal, run dir) plus a getter for the engine's swappable active
workspace and a handful of engine callbacks (emit a plugin hook, save state,
escalate a task, and escalation-pause). The collaborator never receives the
whole ``Engine`` — it cannot reach engine internals beyond those callables.

``Engine`` keeps same-name private methods that delegate here, so its tests and
the ``SweepEngine``/``StoriesEngine`` subclasses (which override nothing in this
cluster) see an unchanged surface.

    or "" when the evidence does not support one. Informational only: the
    orchestrator never replays, merges or cherry-picks the ref, and the paragraph
    never asks the session to.

    Shared by every dev-prompt builder (``Engine._generic_dev_prompt``,
    ``StoriesEngine._stories_dev_prompt``, ``SweepEngine._generic_bundle_prompt``)
    through ``Engine._retry_preserve_notice``; each appends it, as its own
    paragraph, to its fresh-baseline legs only — a repair leg keeps the rejected
    attempt's tree, and a patch-restore leg has already laid that attempt back
    onto it. ``task.preserve_ref`` is set only by an auto-rollback of this task,
    so a set ref already means this dispatch follows a rolled-back attempt.

    Offered only when git confirms the claim, through the verify chokepoint:

    - the name is one this run's rollback mints — ``refs/attempt-preserve-dirty/
      <run>-<baseline8>-<attempt>[-rN]`` with ``<baseline8>`` this task's baseline,
      or the ``attempt-preserve/<run>-<tip8>`` commits branch whose ``<tip8>`` is
      the commit it still resolves to;
    - it resolves to a commit (``rev-parse --verify <ref>^{commit}``) — a ref the
      run-start retention pruned before a resume does not;
    - that commit descends from, and differs from, ``task.baseline_commit`` — so
      the offered ``git diff`` is this task's work over this task's tree. A
      baseline re-stamped past the work (another unit merged first) fails it.

    ``preserve_from_attempt`` must be set: git can show that the ref is this
    run's and sits on this baseline, but not that a dispatched attempt produced
    it. A resolve re-drive parks a tree no attempt wrote, and a sweep bundle
    replacement keeps the superseded bundle's ref on the same key and baseline;
    both leave the flag False.

    Says "an earlier attempt", never "the previous" one: a clean rollback keeps
    an older attempt's ref (see ``rollback_or_pause``), and ``task.attempt`` is
    re-armed to 0 by a resolve, so neither the ref nor the counter proves the
    work is the immediately preceding attempt's. ``preserve_partial`` narrows the
    claim to the commits alone. A failed check omits the paragraph and leaves the
    ref and task untouched: the ref may still be the only copy of that work."""

        resolves candidates under), threaded down rather than re-derived here:
        this is a staticmethod on purpose, and `_workspace_get` is a live getter
        precisely because a unit worktree swaps the root mid-run (``rebased``
        makes ``paths.project`` the mount project there — the worktree root, or
        ``<worktree>/<offset>`` for a project nested in ``repo_root``). It must NOT be
        ``workspace.root``: under the `repo_root` override that is the separate
        code repo, an in-project spec fails its `is_relative_to` test, and the
        chokepoint silently takes the plain arm — dropping the parent walk the
        confinement exists for. An artifacts folder configured outside the
        project is a trusted repair target here (`_attempt_owned_spec`) when
        handle-anchored writes are available.

        ``root_identity`` pins ``confine_root`` (DW-445): the callers pass
        `_mount_root_identity` of it — `runs.mount_root_identity` when the
        workspace is a unit mount, ``None`` for the operator's project — so a
        mount swapped for a link, before or after the spec path was bound,
        refuses with `platform_util.UnconfinedWriteError` (an ``OSError``, raised
        as any unreachable parent is) and nothing lands outside the repository.
        The pin compares the unit worktree against its mint-time record
        (``task.worktree_identity``, DW-446) and walks ``O_NOFOLLOW`` down to
        ``confine_root``, so an ancestor swapped for a link refuses too.

        The write is `frontmatter.set_frontmatter_status_anchored` (DW-323), the
        fifth spec writer: the confinement rule stated in
        `frontmatter.set_frontmatter_status` in-project, a canonical
        filesystem-root walk (not the plain path write) for an external target,
        and one bound target identity checked at the read, before staging and
        immediately before the replace. ``expected`` is the identity
        `_restore_attempt_owned_spec_bytes` just published (DW-319); when the
        file no longer matches it — an operator edit or swap landed between
        restoration and this normalization — nothing is written and the refusal
        becomes `_OwnedSpecAuthorityError`, so the ``*_or_pause`` wrappers clear
        the authority pair and pause with the operator's bytes untouched. The
        final check is not a compare-and-swap: an in-place edit of the old inode

        """Recover from an attempt that won't proceed.

        No-op when the real tree is proven to be at the attempt's baseline:
        neither a reset nor a pause is needed, and an unchanged bound spec is
        never rewritten. The one recognition exception is the exact regular file
        bound in ``task.dispatched_spec_file`` for this attempt. If the real tree
        is dirty but no debris remains after excluding that file, its lifecycle
        status is normalized and the real checkout is probed again without
        exclusions. A genuinely clean checkout with no commits above the attempt
        baseline emits ``rollback-skipped-clean``. If a lifecycle-only attempt
        committed its flip, recovery parks that commit and resets HEAD before
        retrying instead of mistaking the baseline-shaped worktree for a clean
        branch.
        A resolved re-drive whose authorized human-corrected spec remains dirty
        instead emits ``rollback-owned-spec-normalized`` and continues without
        pretending the checkout is clean. Snapshot-backed changes to a pre-existing
        untracked/ignored owned spec are parked explicitly and restored byte-exactly;
        other plain-attempt substantive residue follows ordinary reset/pause policy.

        The clean outcome also lets manual-recovery instructions terminate —
        after the operator resets and resumes, the now-clean tree skips straight
        through instead of re-pausing on the still-set ``baseline_commit``.

        A ``cause="resolved"`` re-drive is human-initiated (the operator ran the
        resolve workflow and re-armed the story), so it bypasses the policy pause
        and selects auto-recovery regardless of ``scm.rollback_on_failure``.
        Unsafe attempt-owned authority can still require manual recovery. For the
        entire re-drive (``task.resolved_redrive``, latched at resume and cleared
        once the correction is committed) the BMAD artifact folders are preserved
        through every reset — so a later mid-re-drive retry/defer reset can't
        silently revert the correction. Whole folders never participate in the
        dirtiness decision; sibling artifact residue remains visible there.

        Otherwise (a stopped/abandoned attempt) recovery depends on where the
        attempt ran. Inside a mounted unit worktree it auto-recovers instead of
        pausing on policy: the worktree is disposable, the attempt's work is parked
        on preserve refs before the reset, and ``scm.rollback_on_failure`` gates
        *in-place* (isolation="none") recovery only (#161). In the main checkout the
        flag governs: OFF (default) leaves the working tree untouched and emits a
        bold manual-recovery notice that pauses the run (stop-and-wait); ON does a
        clean reset to baseline. Either way pre-existing untracked files are
        preserved; there is no blanket ``git clean``.

        The preserve steps and unsafe attempt-owned snapshot authority are the only
        things that can still pause a rollback the branching above chose to
        auto-recover, worktree included: when the attempt's
        committed or uncommitted work cannot be parked and the reset would destroy
        it, they refuse rather than reset (#340). That is a preservation failure
        rather than a policy decision, so it does not weaken #161 — the notice
        targets ``workspace.root``, which is the mounted worktree when there is
        one.

        Plugin hooks bracket only the auto-recover arm: it emits ``pre_rollback``
        before parking/resetting and exactly one paired ``post_rollback`` on every
        exit from it (DW-322), carrying ``rollback_outcome`` — ``"completed"``,
        ``"paused"`` when one of the pauses above propagates, or ``"failed"`` when
        any other exception escapes (it propagates unchanged after the emit). The
        clean short-circuits, the early owned-spec pauses and the policy-OFF manual
        pause emit neither stage.

        ``restart`` marks the call as a resume restart arm (``Engine._finish_inflight``
        or the sweep bundle restart leg) rather than an in-run retry/defer rollback.
        Only then, and only once commits above the baseline or uncommitted changes
        were parked AND ``safe_reset`` completed, does the rollback send a
        parked-work notice naming every ref it parked (DW-371, DW-480, DW-482): on
        resume those commits may have been made while the run was down, and a
        file-only journal entry is too quiet for that. A re-drive's best-effort
        preserve leg that fails still falls through to the reset, but the same
        post-reset notice then names the failed leg and the attempt HEAD, on any
        re-drive reset, restart or not (DW-481)."""

        working-tree changes (tracked edits + run-created untracked files) under a
        named recovery ref, so `reset --hard baseline` and its untracked cleanup
        can't silently destroy in-progress work. Complements
        `_preserve_attempt_commits` (which parks *committed* work above baseline);
        together they cover the whole attempt. No-op when the tree is clean vs HEAD
        — the intended non-destructive uncommitted-revert case.

        A capture failure is a gate, not a footnote (#340 — this reverses the
        original best-effort contract). The two preserve steps used to be
        asymmetric: the commits path refused to reset past work it could not park,
        while a failed snapshot journaled and let the reset run. That protected the
        *more* recoverable half — orphaned commits stay in the object store,
        reachable by reflog/`git fsck` until gc, whereas an uncommitted edit a
        `reset --hard` discards is gone permanently. Both paths now refuse on the
        same terms: with ``allow_pause`` (a plain rollback) pause for manual
        recovery rather than reset; ordinary re-drive preservation remains
        best-effort with ``allow_pause=False``. Snapshot-backed Git-invisible specs
        pass ``allow_pause=True`` even on a re-drive because restoration would
        otherwise overwrite the only child copy. Both paths guard
        ``(GitError, OSError)`` too: spawn faults
        arrive typed as ``GitSpawnError`` since #343, but ``snapshot_worktree``'s
        ``TemporaryDirectory`` can still raise a plain ``OSError`` (ENOSPC),
        which would otherwise crash the rollback rather than refuse it.

        The refusal is gated on :meth:`_reset_would_destroy`, so a capture failure
        over a tree with nothing left to lose (commits already parked, nothing
        uncommitted) still resets instead of halting an unattended run. The failure
        is journaled either way, and ``preserve_partial`` is latched either way —
        on the best-effort re-drive path the reset still runs, so the defer notice
        must still downgrade its claim to the committed half (#338). That
        best-effort fall-through also journals ``attempt-preserve-fallthrough``
        with the attempt HEAD and appends to ``failed_parks``, so the caller's
        post-reset notice says uncommitted work was not preserved (DW-481).

        Returns the snapshot ref this call parked, or ``None`` when it parked
        nothing — a clean tree, no baseline, or a capture failure that did not
        pause. Rollback callers ignore it; the sweep's kept-rival migration reset
        reads the ledger back from it to detect a third writer (DW-435)."""

        arrive as ``GitSpawnError`` since #343, but this runs immediately after a
        snapshot fault — often an ENOSPC out of ``snapshot_worktree``'s
        ``TemporaryDirectory`` — and a filesystem this broken can fail the probe
        in non-spawn ways too. Guarding only `GitError` would undo the broadening
        one frame up and crash the rollback anyway."""

        pause the run. Always raises RunPaused. Four notice shapes: (a, default)
        the OFF path for a stopped/abandoned in-place attempt with no commits of
        its own — plain manual-rollback steps; (b, ``preserve_failed``) rollback is
        ON/resolved but the attempt's commits above baseline could not be parked on
        a recovery ref, so an automatic ``reset --hard`` would silently discard
        them — a distinct notice that names the at-risk commits and never tells the
        operator to blindly reset; (c) the OFF path but the attempt COMMITTED work
        above its baseline (#100: a completed session whose run died before the
        orchestrator folded the result) — instructing a bare ``reset --hard`` there
        would discard finished, possibly already-pushed commits, so this notice
        tells the operator to save and check integration state first; (d,
        ``snapshot_failed``) the uncommitted-work snapshot could not be captured and
        the reset would have destroyed it (#340) — names the at-risk *working tree*
        rather than commits, and offers a git-free rescue because the fault that
        broke the snapshot may still be breaking git.

        The two flags are mutually exclusive by construction: they are raised from
        different call sites, and `preserve_attempt_commits` pauses before
        `preserve_attempt_worktree` ever runs. The initial ``cause=resolved`` unwind
        never reaches here: it auto-recovers regardless of
        ``scm.rollback_on_failure``. A later latched re-drive may use the
        snapshot-failed shape when exact Git-invisible owned-spec bytes could not
        be parked before recovery overwrites them."""
