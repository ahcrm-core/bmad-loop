"""Stop-aware child runner for operator-authored shell commands (DW-353).

The deterministic verify commands (``verify.run_verify_commands``) and the plugin
bus's declarative hooks (``plugins.bus._run_subprocess``) are the two places the
engine blocks on an arbitrary operator command. As plain ``subprocess.run`` calls
they had two faults a hard ``bmad-loop stop`` could land in:

* On native Windows the engine never receives SIGTERM, so the only stop channel
  is the control file — which nobody polled while the command ran. ``stop_run``
  waited out ``runs._STOP_WAIT_S`` and force-killed the engine.
* On POSIX the SIGTERM path, and the timeout leg, killed only the ``/bin/sh``
  root; the command's own children (a test runner's workers, a build daemon)
  were orphaned and kept writing into the worktree.

:func:`run_child` fixes both at one seam. It polls an AMBIENT hard-stop probe
while the child runs and kills the whole process tree on a hard stop, on
timeout, or on any exception unwinding through it, reporting the first as
``interrupted`` — a fact about the run, never a verdict about the command.

:func:`run_argv` is the same supervision for an executable argv with no shell
(``shell=False``, stdin ``DEVNULL``): the bounded ``--version`` liveness probe
(``probe.binary_runs``) runs through it, because ``subprocess.run``'s timeout
kills only the root and then waits unboundedly on pipes a surviving descendant
still holds — the Windows ``.cmd`` launcher case.

The probe is ambient (a ContextVar installed by the outermost ``Engine.run()``,
beside ``runs.set_owner_run_dir``) rather than a parameter, because ``runs``
imports ``verify`` — so neither ``verify`` nor this module can import ``runs`` —
and because the review gates that reach ``run_verify_commands`` hold no run
dir. Outside an engine run no probe is installed (``cli._reverify``, tests,
probes) and the runner never interrupts. The runner only READS the channel;
consuming a hard request stays with the engine's hard-stop arm.

Leaf module: imports nothing from ``runs``, ``verify`` or ``engine``.

      ``_check_timeout`` with the raw chunks joined, *before* the text-mode
      decode that ends the loop, so ``text=True`` never touched them.
    * ``str`` — Windows, where the text wrapper has already decoded.
    * ``None`` — nothing buffered on that stream (POSIX), or a Windows reader
      thread that was still running when the timeout fired.

    So the bytes branch has to reproduce what text mode would have done to them,

    resolves for an unset ``encoding`` — deliberately not ``locale.getencoding()``,
    which disagrees with it under UTF-8 mode (PEP 540), a mode the C/POSIX locale
    enables by itself. ``errors="replace"`` for the reason the completed path uses

    this replaced: the locale codec, with replacement (#378/#383). Spawn faults
    (``OSError``, ``ValueError`` from ``Popen``) propagate untouched — each
    caller owns its translation.

    The probe is read before spawn (a pending hard request spawns nothing) and
    every :data:`STOP_POLL_S` while the child runs. Polling is a
    ``communicate(timeout=...)`` retried in a loop: CPython keeps the collected
    chunks (POSIX) or reader-thread buffers (Windows) across a ``TimeoutExpired``,
    so a retry loses no output. On interrupt or timeout the tree is killed
    (:func:`kill_tree`) and the pipes drained for at most :data:`DRAIN_S`. Any
    exception unwinding through the loop — SIGTERM's ``RunStopped``, a
    ``KeyboardInterrupt`` — kills the tree in ``finally`` with kill errors
    suppressed, and the original exception propagates.

    A child that exits on its own is not tree-killed: a completed command's
    leftover background processes are the command's business, exactly as they
    were under ``subprocess.run``.

    across a harvest therefore stays reachable after its shell exits — the case
    one pre-signal harvest could never see, because a reparented process can no
    longer be enumerated from the root. The tree stays bounded over a long run:
    an entry a fresh harvest no longer lists is pruned once it is gone or reused

    win32 root ``force_kill`` first), bounded drain and ``finally`` kill on an

    spawn: ``argv`` goes to ``Popen`` as a list with ``shell=False``, so its
    element boundaries are kept exactly as given — it is never joined into a
    shell string — and stdin is ``DEVNULL``, so a child that prompts reads EOF
    instead of blocking on the caller's tty until the timeout.

    Why a probe needs this rather than ``subprocess.run(argv, timeout=...)``: on
    timeout ``run`` kills the ROOT and then waits for the pipes with no bound. A
    Windows ``.cmd`` launcher is rooted at ``cmd.exe`` (CreateProcess runs batch
    files through it even without ``shell=True``), so killing the root leaves the
    real program alive holding the pipes, and ``run`` returned only when that
    program exited on its own — a 0.5 s timeout observed at 120 s. Here the whole
    tree is killed and the drain gives up after :data:`DRAIN_S`.

    Batch files: the host OS may parse a ``.cmd``/``.bat`` command line by
    ``cmd.exe`` rules with no escaping from Python (the ``subprocess`` docs'
    warning). ``argv`` must therefore not carry untrusted text for such a target;
    the probe callers pass a resolved binary path and a fixed flag.

    it. Finally the known stragglers are reaped — only those whose recorded

    signalled — after each survivor's own descendants are harvested into the tree.

    A root that already exited is never signalled or harvested (its pid is

    With no known tree an exited root makes no host calls at all.

    Never ``os.killpg`` or ``os.kill``: the child is not detached into its own
    group (that would change what a console Ctrl-C reaches), and every signal

    exits at once is missed the same way: the grace re-harvest catches the fork
    only if the root lives one :data:`_REAP_POLL_S` re-scan after it. The loop
    harvests only while the ROOT runs; once it has exited, a surviving job's own
    children are reached only by the one-shot survivor sub-harvest here, so a
    descendant of that job that was already reparented away from it is missed,
